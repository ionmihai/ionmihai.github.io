Below we show that, all else equal, bonds will have higher duration (and hence more price risk) if they have a:\n\n- Longer maturity or\n- Lower yield to maturity (YTM) or\n- Lower coupon rate\n\nTo calculate Macaulay's duration use the **DURATION** function in Excel, with the ususal parameters (settlement date, maturity date, etc). To calculate modified duration, use the **MDURATION** function, with the same parameters.\n\n## Example 1:  Duration is higher for bonds with longer maturity\n\nBonds A, B and C all have coupon rate and YTM of 6% (semiannual, par=1000). They were all issued today and mature in 1 year (bond A), 10 years (bond B) and 30 years (bond C). Calculate their duration.\n\n\n## Example 2:  Duration is higher for bonds with lower YTM\n\nBonds A, B and C all have a coupon rate of 4% (semiannual, par=1000) and mature in 10 years. They were all issued today and have a YTM of 2% (bond A), 4% (bond B) and 6% (bond C). Calculate their duration.\n\n## Example 3:  Duration is higher for bonds with lower coupon rates\n\nBonds A, B and C all have a YTM of 6% (semiannual, par=1000) and mature in 10 years. They were all issued today and have a coupon rate of 3% (bond A), 6% (bond B) and 9% (bond C).

Use their **duration** to estimate the price impact (in %) of an **increase** in YTM of 0.5%.\n2.
