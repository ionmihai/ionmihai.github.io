Below, we work through a couple of examples that show how this can be achieved.\n\n**Example 1: Using options to increase risk**\n\nThis usually involves buying option on stocks instead of buying/shorting the stocks themselves.\n\nTo see the difference, consider the following two strategies:\n\n- Stategy A: invest $9000 in stock A by buying 100 shares at $90 each\n- Stategy B: Use the $9000 to buy 900 call options on stock A (trading at $10 an option). The strike price is $90 and the options expire in a year.\n\nCalculate what your (%) return would be for each strategy, if the price a year from now is:\n\n- $75\n- $90\n- $105\n\n**Example 2: Using options to decrease risk**\n\nYou can limit your losses from buying a particular stock by also purchasing put options on that stock. This is called the *protective put* strategy.\n\nTo see how this works, consider the following two strategies:\n\n- Strategy A: buy one share of AMZN for $100\n- Strategy B: you buy one share of AMZN for $100 and a put option on AMZN that costs you an additional $5. The put option has a strike price of $95 and it expires in 3 months.\n\nQ1: What is your % return for each strategy, if the price of AMZN 3 months from now is:\n\n- $0\n- $95\n- $105\n- $150\n\nQ2: Draw the payoff and profit for this protective put, as functions of the price of AMZN\n\n# Volatility bets with options\n\nYou can use options to trade based on your opinions about volatility. Below are two examples that show you how this would work.\n\n\n**Example 3: Betting on volatility**\n\nYou buy a call option on stock X for $10 an option and you also buy a put option on stock X for $5 an option. Both options have strike price of $100. For what values of the price of the underlying asset X would you make a positive profit? Draw the payoff and profit of this strategy as a function of the underlying stock price.\n\n\n**Example 4: Betting against volatility**\n\nYou sell a call option on stock X for $10 an option and you also sell a put option on stock X for $5 an option. Both options have strike price of $100. For what values of the price of the underlying asset X would you make a positive profit?
