The derivative means that the value of these assets depends on the value of a different asset (often called the \"underlying\" asset).\n\n\nA call option is a financial asset (a contract really) that gives you the right (but not the obligation) to \n\n- **buy** a particular stock (called the *underlying* stock) \n- at a particular price (called the *strike* price)\n- on or before a particular date (called the *expiration* date)\n    - the \"or before\" only applies to *American* options\n    - for *European* options you are not allowed to exercise your option before the expiration date\n        - you can assume that all the options we talk about in this class are American options\n\nThe price you have to pay to buy an option is called the *premium* of that option.\n\nWhen/if you choose to buy the underlying asset, we say that you are *exercising* your option. It only makes sense to do so when the stock is trading at a price higher than the strike price of the option.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nOn Oct 14, 2014, a call option on Facebook (FB), expiring on Nov 14, 2014 with strike price of $75 sold for $5. The price of FB on Oct 14 was $76.\n\nQ1: For this call option, what is the:\n\n- Underlying asset\n- Strike price\n- Expiration date\n- Premium\n\nQ2: What is your profit if you exercise this option immediately after you buy it?\n\nQ3: Suppose on Oct 21, 2014, FB is trading at $74 a share. Would you exercise the option? \n\nQ4: Suppose right before the call option expires (on Nov-14, 2014), FB is trading at $76 a share. Would you exercise the option?\n\n## Call option payoff and profit\n\nThe **payoff** (revenue) of a call option that you own is the difference between the underlying stock price (let's call it S) and the option's strike price (let's call it X) *when $S > X$ and 0 otherwise* (since you wouldn't exercise it when $S < X$). \n\n$$Payoff = max(S - X, 0)$$\n\nThe profit from the call option equals its payoff minus it premium (i.e. the price you paid to buy the option). \n\n$$Profit = max(S - X, 0) - Premium$$\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nYou buy a call option on stock A for a premium of $14. The strike price is $80 and the option expires in a month. \n\nQ1: What is the payoff from this call option if the price of stock A is $60? How about $70? $80? $90? $100?\n\nQ2: What is the profit from the call option in each of those scenarios?\n\nQ3: Draw a graph that shows your payoff (revenue) and your profit as a function of the price of stock A. \n\n## Selling (writing) call options\n\nIf you sell (aka \"write\") a call option, you are in the opposite position from the person who buys it: you give them the option (but not the obligation) to buy the underlying asset from you at a given strike price. If they decide to exercise that option, you (as the seller of the option) are *obligated* to sell them the underlying stock at the strike price (even though it might be trading at a higher price on the market).\n\nThe **payoff** (revenue) of a call option that you *sell* is the negative of the payoff to the person that bought it: \n\n$$Payoff = - max(S - X, 0)$$\n\nThe profit from selling a call option equals the negative of the profit to the person that bought it:\n\n$$Profit = - max(S - X, 0) + Premium$$\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nYou sell a call option on stock A for a premium of $10.
