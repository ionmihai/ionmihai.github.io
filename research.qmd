* **Abstract:**\
        Using the policy uncertainty index of Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013), we document a strong negative relationship between firm-level capital investment and the aggregate level of uncertainty associated with future policy and regulatory outcomes. More importantly, we find evidence that the relation between policy uncertainty and capital investment is not uniform in the cross section, being significantly stronger for firms with a higher degree of investment irreversibility and for firms which are more dependent on government spending. Our results lend empirical support to the notion that policy uncertainty can depress corporate investment by inducing precautionary delays due to investment irreversibility.

### [Does Policy Uncertainty Affect Mergers and Acquisitions? (2018)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2813466)
with Alice Bonaime, and Huseyin Gulen


* **Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 129 (3), 2018, 531-558**
* **Abstract:**\
        Political and regulatory uncertainty is strongly negatively associated with merger and acquisition activity at the macro and firm levels. The strongest effects are for uncertainty regarding taxes, government spending, monetary and fiscal policies, and regulation. Consistent with a real options channel, the effect is exacerbated for less reversible deals and for firms whose product demand or stock returns exhibit greater sensitivity to policy uncertainty, but attenuated for deals that cannot be delayed due to competition and for deals that hedge firm-level risk. Contractual mechanisms (deal premiums, termination fees, MAC clauses) unanimously point to policy uncertainty increasing the targetâ€™s negotiating power.

### [Exports, Investment, and Policy Uncertainty (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2833536)
with Andrew Greenland and John Lopresti


* **Canadian Journal of Economics, Vol. 52 (3) 2019, 1248-1288**
* **Abstract:**\
        Building on a literature that underscores the value of delaying investment in the face of uncertainty, we study how policy uncertainty in fifteen large economies affects trade flows into these countries. We show that high levels of uncertainty in destination markets are associated with significantly lower exports to those markets. Furthermore, consistent with a model in which firms face irreversible costs to export, we show that this effect is entirely driven by a reduction in the entry of new products. Finally, we find that the effect of uncertainty on trade flows is significantly stronger when trade costs are less reversible.

### [The Use of Asset Growth in Empirical Asset Pricing Models](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3026534)
with Michael Cooper and Huseyin Gulen


* **Revise and Resubmit at the Journal of Financial Economics**
* **Abstract:**\
     We show that the performance of the new factor models of Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) and Fama and French (2015) depends crucially on how their investment factor is constructed. Both models use growth in total assets to measure investment. Their ability to price the cross-section of returns decreases significantly when the investment factor is constructed using traditional investment measures, or measures that also account for investment in intangibles. In contrast, we find that factors based on growth in inventory and accounts receivable contain the bulk of the pricing information in the asset growth factor. We show evidence that the superior performance of the asset growth factor seems to be attributable to its ability to capture aggregate shocks to equity financing costs.

### [Credit Cycles, Expectations, and Corporate Investment](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3369295)
with Huseyin Gulen and Stefano Rossi


* **Revise and Resubmit at the Review of Financial Studies**
* **Abstract:**\
        We provide a systematic empirical assessment of the Minsky (1977) hypothesis that business fluctuations are due to irrational swings in expectations. We build an aggregate index of irrational expectations using predictable firm level forecast errors and use it to provide three sets of results. First, we show that such an index of irrational expectations drives aggregate credit cycles. Next, we build an aggregate index of predictable credit cycles as the portion of credit cycles predicted by irrational expectations, and we show that such index drives cycles in firm-level debt issuance and investment. Finally, we show that after increases (re., decreases) in credit market sentiment firm-level financing and investment cycles are more pronounced for firms with ex ante more optimistic (re., pessimistic) expectations. Financial constraints do not have additional explanatory power for firm-level cycles in the cross section once irrational expectations are considered. We rationalize these results within a parsimonious dynamic Q-theory model with risky debt in which both corporate managers and credit investors hold diagnostic expectations.

### [Using Equity Market Reactions to Infer Exposure to Trade Liberalization](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3649874)
with Andrew Greenland, John Lopresti, and Peter Schott


* *NBER Working Paper No. w27510*
* **Abstract:**\
        We propose a method for identifying exposure to changes in trade policy based on asset prices that has several advantages over standard measures: it encompasses all avenues of exposure, it is natively firm-level, it yields estimates for both goods and service producers, and it can be used to study reductions in difficult-to-quantify non-tariff barriers in a way that controls naturally for broader macroeconomic shocks. Applying our method to two well-studied US trade liberalizations provides new insight into service sector responses to trade liberalizations as well as dramatically different responses among small versus large firms, even within narrow industries.

### [Policy Uncertainty, Corporate Risk-Taking, and CEO Incentives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3039734)
with David Yin


* **Abstract:**\
        We show evidence that CEO risk-taking incentives represent a key mechanism through which policy uncertainty impacts the real economy. We document that high levels of policy uncertainty are associated with significantly lower future stock return volatility. This relation is stronger (more negative) for firms where the CEO has higher compensation delta or less transferable skills, and is weaker when the CEO has higher compensation vega. Furthermore, when policy uncertainty is high, firms are more likely to use financial hedging instruments and engage in more diversifying mergers, and CEOs sell more own-firm shares and exercise fewer options.
