    "To install Python, we will actually install a different program, called Anaconda, which comes with Python and many other tools frequently used in Data Science. Anaconda takes a lot more space than Python itself, but the benefit is that it comes with everything you need for this course (and likely any other course you will ever take on Machine Learning or Data Science). Once you install Anaconda, install Jupyter Notebook and VS Code following the instructions below.\n",

    "3. Follow the instructions on the screen\n",
    "    - For additional instructions on installation, see the \"Resources\" section below\n",
    "    - When in doubt, use the default settings suggested by the Anaconda installer\n",
    "    \n",
    "To open Anaconda:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows\n",
    "    - From the Start menu, click the Anaconda Navigator desktop app\n",
    "- macOS\n",
    "    - Open Launchpad, then click the Anaconda Navigator icon\n",

    "- On Anaconda Navigator’s Home tab, in the Applications pane on the right, scroll to the Jupyter Notebook (not JupyterLab) tile and click the Install button to install Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "### Installing VS Code\n",
    "This is an IDE (integrated development environment) that can run Jupyter notebooks too. I will be using it during class, but you do not have to (as explained in the following section). I strongly recommend you install it though, since it comes with some very useful functionality when writing code (e.g. autocompletion, integrated terminal etc). \n",
