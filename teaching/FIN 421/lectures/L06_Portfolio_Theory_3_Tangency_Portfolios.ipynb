    "Given a set of risky assets, what is the best portfolio we can construct with them? Assuming we are mean-variance optimizers, this amounts to finding the set of weights that gives us the portfolio with the **maximum Sharpe ratio** (i.e. the portfolio that gives us the best expected return per unit of risk). We start by learning how to do this for the special case when we only have two risky assets and then move on to the general case with an arbitrary (\"N\") number of assets. These maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios are also called **optimal risky portfolios** or **tangency portfolios**."

What depends on their risk aversion is the proportion of their funds they should invest in this optimal risky portfolio. We touched on this in the previous lecture, and we will talk about it in much more detail in the following lecture."

Call those assets A and B, and assume we have already estimated their expected returns ($E[R_A]$ and $E[R_B]$), their standard deviations ($\\sigma_A$ and $\\sigma_B$) and their covariance ($COV[R_A, R_B]$ sometimes denoted $\\rho_{AB}$).\n",

As mentioned above, this amounts to finding the $w_A$ that gives us the portfolio with the highers possible Sharpe ratio. Before we do this (in Section 2.2.) we first construct a large number of portfolios for different values of $w_A$ to get a better sense of how these portfolios look like from a mean-variance perspective. \n"

Construct 21 different portfolios of FB and NFLX by starting out with a weight of 0% in FB and progressively increasing it by 5% until you reach a portfolio with 100% in FB. For each portfolio, estimate its expected return and standard deviation of future returns and plot it in mean-volatility space.   "
