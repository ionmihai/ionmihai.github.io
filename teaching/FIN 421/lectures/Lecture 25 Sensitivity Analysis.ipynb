    "Our valuation results suggest that there is quite a bit of variance in our estimates of the value of MSFT. We have to remember that, even though we obtained many different estimates for this value, each of those estimates relies on some pretty strict assumptions that could easily not hold in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a sensitivity analysis is to obtain an idea of just how much our estimates vary when we change some of the crucial assumptions behind our valuation methods.\n",
