This portion is often referred to as the stock's **idiosyncratic risk**. The remaining portion, which can not be diversified away is often called its **systematic risk**. \n",

    "The single-factor model is a statistical model which assumes that all sources of systematic risk (economic factors that affect all firms to some extent) are captured by the returns on the market portfolio. If this is the case, then firm excess returns can be written as a linear function of market excess returns (for every firm $i$ and time $t$):\n",
