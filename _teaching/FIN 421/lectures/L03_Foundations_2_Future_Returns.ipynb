    "We start thinking about future returns. We model them as random variables and we are interested in estimating the expectation and volatility of the probability distribution associated with these random variables. We will use sample means to estimate the expectation (i.e. expected returns) and the sample standard deviation to estimate the volatility (i.e. total risk). We then introduce the concept of a risk premium and we show how investments should be assessed based on the risk - return tradeoff they offer.\n",

    "Investments are about **future** rewards. We hope that we have found an investment that will give us high rewards, but because we can never perfectly predict the future, there will always be some amount of uncertainty associated with any investment. Hence, to give ourselves a chance at some **expected return**, we must expose ourselves to some amount of **risk** that we may loose money from that investment. The goal is to find investments which we *believe* (we can not know) will provide us with a good risk-return tradeoff: a large expected return per unit of risk. We will see below that this is called the **Sharpe ratio** of that investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to make good investment decisions, we must find a way to measure (estimate) the risk-return tradeoff they offer. As explained above, this entails estimating the risk and expected return of that investment. We do so by thinking about future returns on that investment as random variables: the future return is an unknown (random) quantity which takes possible values according to some probability distribution. The mean of that probability distribution is the expected return on the investment, and the standard deviation of that distribution is a good measure of the risk of the investment because it quantifies how uncertain we would be if we were to predict future returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mean and standard deviation of future returns are unknown quantities because future returns are unknown quantities. To estimate them, we must assume that *past* returns came from the same probability distribution as future returns. If that is a good assumption, then we can use data on past returns to estimate the mean and standard deviation of future returns.\n",
