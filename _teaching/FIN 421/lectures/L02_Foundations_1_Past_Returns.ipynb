    "# Holding period return (HPR)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this when we want to calculate the total (net) return of a stock over a give period of time (the \"holding period\") and we know the value of the stock at the start and the end of that period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, to calculate the HPR of any financial asset, we must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the value at the end of the holding period of all the cash flows generated by that asset during the holding period\n",
    "    - For a stock, this equals the price of the stock at the end of the holding period plus whatever dividends the stock may have paid during the holding period\n",
    "2. Divide this future value of cash flows by the initial value of the asset (at the beginning of the holding period)\n",
    "    - For a stock this equals the price of the stock at the beginning of the holding period\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that the above gives you the gross HPR. We usually subtract 1 to obtain the net HPR.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for stocks, the HPR over the time period spanning from time $T_{1}$ to time $T_{2}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$HPR_{T_{1} \\rightarrow T_{2}} = \\frac{P_{T_{2}} + D_{T_{2}}}{P_{T_{1}}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{T_{1}}$ is the price of the stock at time $T_{1}$, $P_{T_{2}}$ is the price at time ${T_{2}}$ and $D_{T_{2}}$ is the dividend of the stock paid at time $T_{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above formula is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$HPR_{T_{1} \\rightarrow T_{2}} = \\frac{P_{T_{2}} - P_{T_{1}}}{P_{T_{1}}} + \\frac{D_{T_{2}}}{P_{T_{1}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term on the right side of the equation is called the **capital gains** from the investment and the second term is called the **dividend yield** of the investment. "
