    "# Special case: two risky assets\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formulas apply for any arbitrary number of risky assets N. However, to build intuition, here, we provide the formulas for the special case when we have only N = 2 risky assets. This special case is actually very important because your risky assets don't have to be individual assets (e.g. FB or TSLA). They can be portfolios. For example, one of your risky assets may be the S\\&P500 (e.g. an ETF like SPY which tracks the S\\&P500) and the other risky asset may be a diversified bond portfolio (e.g. an ETF like BND from Vanguard). In this case, solving for the optimal asset allocation decision is equivalent to deciding the optimal proportion of your funds to invest in stocks, bonds, and cash (or cash-equivalent assets). This is a very important investment decision, one that you will have to make very soon, for example, when you set up your 401(K). \n",
