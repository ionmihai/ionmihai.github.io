    "# Valuation using multiples: The general approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea behind using multiples to estimate the intrinsic value of a firm is that intrinsic value should have a stable relationship with some fundamental aspects of the firm (e.g. its profits or its book value). If this is the case, and we have a way to estimate this relation, then we can use it to back out the intrinsic value of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we have a way to estimate the firm's true value to earnings ratio. We can then multiply this estimate by the firm's earnings, and that would give us an estimate for the firm's value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common ways of estimating the true value of any given multiple for a firm:\n",
    "- Take an average of this multiple for a handful of close competitors of the firm you are valuing\n",
    "- Take an average of this multiple for the entire industry of the firm you are valuing\n",
    "- Take an average over the past values of this multiple for the firm you are valuing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason why we say that multiples valuation is a form of *comparables* valuation, where comparables are firms that are similar in some fundamental way to the firm we are valuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate this technique below, using three common multiples:\n",
    "- Price to earnings ratios (P/E)\n",
    "- Price to book ratios (P/B, aka market to book ratios or M/B)\n",
    "- (Total) Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratios (TEV/EBITDA)"
